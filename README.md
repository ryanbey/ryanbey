<h3><b>Hi, I'm Ryan! :smile:</b></h3>

I'm a detail oriented and UX driven web developer that is passionate about practical user experiences and writing beautiful code. I'm a full time front-end dev at <a href="https://github.com/familysearch" target="_blank">@FamilySearch</a> and I own and maintain [Nyoom](https://nyoom.app), a stat tracking and comparison web app for [iRacing](https://iracing.com) members.
